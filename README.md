### Hi, I'm Azad Furkan
#### (Civil Engineer, Jr. PHP Developer, Graffiti Artist)


<div style="text-align: justify">
I completed my undergraduate education on civil engineering. After 3 years of working history, I started to improve myself in this field due to my interest in web development. During this period, I primarily wrote my personal website, the corporate website of the company I work for, and websites that use PHP language for other individuals and institutions. I still continue to work as a self-employed person.
